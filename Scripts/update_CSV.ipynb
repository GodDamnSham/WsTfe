There are four people visible in the scene, each with different skis and attire, indicating that they might be competing or participating in a skiing event. \\n\\n\\nThe scene also includes several additional objects scattered across the area. A few bottles are placed at various positions on the mountain slope, with one bottle located close to the left side of the trail, and another located farther right. There is a cell phone in the center of the image, near the middle part of the trail.', 'The image is a green background with two yellow speech bubbles, one at the left side and another at the right side. The bubble on the left side has the text \"305 millions toilets saved\" in white letters, while the bubble on the right side contains the text \"56 million lives improved\" in white letters. \\n\\n\\nIn the middle of the scene, there is a golden trophy displayed with the same green color as the background. This trophy symbolizes the achievement in saving toilets and improving lives through efficient toilet solutions.', 'The image showcases a banner with the title, \"Kids\\' 10k in Miami\" prominently placed across the top of it. It highlights the event taking place on November 18th, and is inviting kids to participate in an interactive run on that date.

The left section describes the race\\'s distance – starting with the words, \"Run 10k\", while the right section provides some vital information about the event\\'s location – \"Location: Miami\". A small map with multiple locations spread throughout the city can be seen below these details, giving children an idea of where the race will take place.\\n\\n\\nOverall, the image effectively promotes the Kids\\' 10k in Miami, inviting young participants to register for the exciting event.', 'The image displays a large banner advertising the \"2020 stage in sport\" event. The banner is colorful and informative, with numerous elements to attract potential attendees. There are numerous people in the background of the image, making it appear to be an active and engaging environment.\\n\\n\\nThe event banner features \"Stage in sport\" written prominently across the top, while the tagline \"DAGABOOM YOUNG SPORT\" is placed beneath it.
